# Ngrx Testing

This project was built with a simple store to test the basics of NgRx. Basically consists of two components/routes, one for informing a user id, redirecting to the other wich requests todos from [JSON Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos) based on the chosen user id.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.3.
